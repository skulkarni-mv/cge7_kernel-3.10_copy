Broadcom Northstar2 IOMUX Controller

The Northstar2 IOMUX controller supports group based mux configuration. In
addition, certain pins can be muxed to GPIO function individually.

Required properties:

- compatible:
    Must be "brcm,northstar2-pinmux"

- reg:
    Define the base and range of the I/O address space that contains the Northstar2
IOMUX registers

Required properties in child nodes:

- function:
    The mux function to select

- groups:
    The list of groups to select with a given function

Each child node represents a configuration. Client devices reference the child
node to enable a mux configuration

For more details, refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt

For example:

	pinmux: pinmux@0x0301d0c8 {
		compatible = "brcm,northstar2-pinmux";
		reg = <0x0301d0c8 0x1b0>;

		i2s_0: i2s_0 {
			function = "i2s0";
			groups = "i2s0_0_grp", "i2s0_1_grp";
		};

		i2s_1: i2s_1 {
			function = "i2s1";
			groups = "i2s1_0_grp", "i2s1_1_grp";
		};

		i2s_2: i2s_2 {
			function = "i2s2";
			groups = "i2s2_0_grp", "i2s2_1_grp", "i2s2_2_grp",
				 "i2s2_3_grp", "i2s2_4_grp";
		};

		spi_0: spi_0 {
			function = "spi0";
			groups = "spi0_grp";
		};
	}

	spi0@18028000 {
			compatible = "arm,pl022", "arm,primecell";
			reg = <0x18028000 0x1000>;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 78 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
			pinctrl-0 = <&spi_0>;
			clocks = <&axi81_clk>;
			clock-names = "apb_pclk";
	};
