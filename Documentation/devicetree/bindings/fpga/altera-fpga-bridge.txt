Altera FPGA Bridge Driver

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "<manufacturer>,<type>"
                 "altr,socfpga-fpga2sdram-bridge"
		 "altr,socfpga-hps2fpga-bridge"
		 "altr,socfpga-lwhps2fpga-bridge"
		 "altr,socfpga-fpga2hps-bridge"

Required for fpga2sdram bridge only:
  - read-port  : which read port is used for this bridge (0-3)
  - write-port : which write port is used for this bridge (0-3)
  - control-ports : which conrtol port(s) are used for this bridge.
                    index 0 is first port # (0-5)
		    index 1 is number of ports used (1-2)

Optional properties:
  - label      : name that you want this bridge to show up as under /sys
                 Default is br<device#> if this is not specified

  - enable     : If 'enable' is specified, the bridge will be enabled or
                 disabled upon load, depending on the value of this parameter.
		 if 'enable' is not specified, the driver will not enable
		 or disable the bridge by default.

Example:
	hps_fpgabridge0: fpgabridge@0 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-hps2fpga-bridge";
		label = "hps2fpga";
		enable = <1>;
	};

	hps_fpgabridge1: fpgabridge@1 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-lwhps2fpga-bridge";
		label = "lwhps2fpga";
	};

	hps_fpgabridge2: fpgabridge@2 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-fpga2hps-bridge";
		label = "fpga2hps";
	};

	hps_fpgabridge3: fpgabridge@3 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-fpga2sdram-bridge";
		label = "fpga2sdram0";
		read-port = <0>;
		write-port = <0>;
		control-ports = <0 2>; /* ports 0 and 1 */
		enable = <1>;
	};

	hps_fpgabridge4: fpgabridge@4 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-fpga2sdram-bridge";
		label = "fpga2sdram1";
		read-port = <1>;
		write-port = <1>;
		control-ports = <2 1>; /* port 2 only */
	};

	hps_fpgabridge5: fpgabridge@5 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-fpga2sdram-bridge";
		label = "fpga2sdram2";
		read-port = <2>;
		write-port = <2>;
		control-ports = <3 1>; /* port 3 only */
	};

	hps_fpgabridge6: fpgabridge@6 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-fpga2sdram-bridge";
		label = "fpga2sdram3";
		read-port = <3>;
		write-port = <3>;
		control-ports = <4 2>; /* ports 4 and 5 */
	};
