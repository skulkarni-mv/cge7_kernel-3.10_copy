* Clock bindings for Marvell MVEBU Armada8K SoCs

Marvell MVEBU Armada 8K SoCs usually allow to determine clock frequencies by
reading the Sample-At-Reset (SAR) register. The clocks consumer should
specify the desired clock by having the clock ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Armada APN 806:
 0 = DDR
 1 = Ring
 2 = CPU
 3 = PIDI AP
 4 = PIDI AP

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Armada APN 806 RING dividers:
 0 = Ring 0
 1 = Ring 2
 2 = Ring 3
 3 = Ring 4
 4 = Ring 5

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of the following:
	"marvell,armada-apn806-clock" - For Armada Armada APN 806 clocks
	"marvell,armada-apn806-ring-clock" - For Armada Armada APN 806 RING clocks dividers
- reg : shall be the register address of the Sample-At-Reset (SAR) register
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1

Example:

ap806clk: device-sar@0x6F8200 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-apn806-clock";
	reg = <0x6F8204 0x04>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};

ringclk: server-control@0x6F8250 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-apn806-ring-clock";
	reg = <0x6F8250 0x04>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&ap806clk 1>;

};

serial@512100 {
	compatible = "snps,dw-apb-uart";
	reg = <0x512100 0x100>;
	clock-frequency = <25000000>;
	reg-shift = <2>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 29 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	reg-io-width = <1>;
	clocks = <&ringclk 2>;
};
