 * will be significant as the ioctl will wait until error bits not already
 * contained in 'ignore_mask' are asserted. If 'timeout' is non-zero, the ioctl
 * will return after that many milliseconds if there have been no new error
 * interrupts. The ioctl returns with -EINTR if a signal is received, 1 if the
 * timeout elapsed, or 0 (success) if there were non-ignored error bits. The
 * monitor logic for devices retains existing error bits in the interrupt
 * status but prevents those error bits from asserting interrupts repeatedly.
 * In particular, an error on the control device prevents channels from
 * resetting until it has been cleared (the behaviour is intentional). So any
 * bits in 'clear_mask' will cause those bits to be cleared from the interrupt
