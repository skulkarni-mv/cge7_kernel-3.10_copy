config FSL_DPAA_OFFLINE_PORTS
	bool "Offline Ports support"
	depends on FSL_DPAA_ETH
	default y
	---help---
	  The Offline Parsing / Host Command ports (short: OH ports, of Offline ports) provide
	  most of the functionality of the regular, online ports, except they receive their
	  frames from a core or an accelerator on the SoC, via QMan frame queues,
	  rather than directly from the network.
	  Offline ports are configured via PCD (Parse-Classify-Distribute) schemes, just like
	  any online FMan port. They deliver the processed frames to frame queues, according
	  to the applied PCD configurations.

	  Choosing this feature will not impact the functionality and/or performance of the system,
	  so it is safe to have it.

		  Optimize the DPAA-Ethernet driver for termination (TCP, UDP) use-cases.

	default y
	depends on FSL_DPAA_ETH
	---help---
	  The DPAA-Ethernet driver defines a ndo_select_queue() callback for optimal selection
	  of the egress FQ. That will override the XPS support for this netdevice.
	  If for whatever reason you want to be in control of the egress FQ-to-CPU selection and mapping,
	  or simply don't want to use the driver's ndo_select_queue() callback, then unselect this
	  and use the standard XPS support instead.

	  The DPAA-Ethernet driver will start replenishing buffer pools whose count
	  falls below this threshold. This must be related to DPAA_ETH_MAX_BUF_COUNT. One needn't normally
	  modify this value unless one has very specific performance reasons.
