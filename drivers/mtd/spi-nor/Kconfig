config MTD_SPI_NOR_USE_4K_SECTORS
	bool "Use small 4096 B erase sectors"
	default y
	help
	  Many flash memories support erasing small (4096 B) sectors. Depending
	  on the usage this feature may provide performance gain in comparison
	  to erasing whole blocks (32/64 KiB).
	  Changing a small part of the flash's contents is usually faster with
	  small sectors. On the other hand erasing should be faster when using
	  64 KiB block instead of 16 Ã— 4 KiB sectors.

	  Please note that some tools/drivers/filesystems may not work with
	  4096 B erase size (e.g. UBIFS requires 15 KiB as a minimum).

config MTD_SPI_NOR_TMP_4BYTE
	bool "Avoid keeping device in 4-byte address mode"
	default n
	help
	  For flash memories larger than 16 Mib, 4 bytes are needed for
	  addressing. For compatibility, these chips by default still use
	  3-byte addresses, which limits accessible space to 16 Mib.
	  To access the rest, chip has to be explicitly switched to 4-byte
	  address mode, that changes standard read/write/erase opcodes to
	  expect 4-byte addresses. Alternatively, some chips provide dedicated
	  opcodes that use 4-byte addresses without standard opcodes behavior.

	  4-byte address mode can be problematic for boards that boot from
	  SPI flash: in case of software reboot, chip remains in 4-byte address
	  mode, while boot hardware and/or firmware expects 3-byte address mode.
	  This commonly results into boot hang.

	  Some chips (i.e. Micron n25q512a) do provide dedicated 4-byte read
	  opcodes, but not dedicated 4-byte write/erase opcodes. By default,
	  driver does switch such a chip to 4-byte address mode.

	  With this option enabled, driver keeps such a chip in default
	  3-byte address mode, and temporary switches it to 4-byte address
	  mode for duration of write/erase operaions. This workarounds reboot
	  issue at cost of slight write/erase performance decrease.

	  If soft-reboot happens in the middle of write/erase operation, chip
	  is left in 4-byte address mode and thus reboot can fail. For
	  reliable operation, need to provide a workaround in hardware or
	  firmware, or simply not use booting from affected chip.

	  If you don't understand what's all that about, just say N.
